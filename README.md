Absolutely! Let's provide a more detailed description of the ScaleIt project, including its purpose, architecture, key features, and potential use cases.

# ScaleIt Application Technical Documentation

## Overview

The ScaleIt application is a robust and flexible solution designed to dynamically adjust the number of replicas for a target application based on real-time CPU utilization metrics. It operates as a standalone Spring Boot-based Java application, providing an easy-to-use RESTful API for monitoring the application's status and dynamically modifying the number of replicas.

## Purpose

The primary goal of ScaleIt is to automate the scaling process of a target application, enabling efficient resource utilization and improved responsiveness to varying workloads. By monitoring CPU utilization and adjusting the number of replicas accordingly, ScaleIt ensures optimal performance and resource utilization, making it an ideal solution for microservices architectures and containerized applications.

## Architecture

The ScaleIt application follows a modular and extensible architecture, leveraging the Spring Boot framework for simplicity and ease of development. Key components of the architecture include:

- **Controller Layer:** Responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and orchestrating interactions with the underlying services.
  
- **Service Layer:** Implements the business logic for monitoring the application's status and adjusting replica counts. This layer also interfaces with external APIs for metrics retrieval.

- **External APIs:** The application interacts with external APIs, such as the target application's status API and the APIs for adjusting the replica count.

- **Configuration:** The application's behavior can be customized through the `application.properties` file, allowing users to set properties like the default server port.

## Key Features

### Dynamic Scaling

ScaleIt continuously monitors the CPU utilization of the target application. When the CPU utilization deviates from the desired threshold, ScaleIt dynamically adjusts the number of replicas, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.

### RESTful API

The application exposes a RESTful API that allows users to retrieve the current status of the target application and modify the replica count as needed.

### Configurability

ScaleIt provides flexibility through configuration properties, allowing users to customize parameters such as the default server port and potentially other scaling-related thresholds.

## Use Cases

ScaleIt is suitable for a variety of use cases, including:

- **Microservices Architecture:** Ideal for applications built using a microservices architecture, where the number of instances of a service needs to scale dynamically based on demand.

- **Containerized Environments:** Well-suited for containerized applications running in platforms like Kubernetes, where automatic scaling based on resource utilization is crucial.

- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Ensures efficient utilization of computing resources by dynamically adjusting the application's footprint in response to varying workloads.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Maven (for building the project)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/scaleit-application.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd scaleit-application
    ```

3. **Build the project using Maven:**

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

## Configuration

The ScaleIt application allows configuration through the `application.properties` file. The primary configuration is the server port.

1. **Open `src/main/resources/application.properties`:**

    ```properties
    # Set the default server port
    server.port=8123
    ```

    Replace `8123` with the desired default port for the application.

## Usage

### GET /app/status

Retrieves the current status of the ScaleIt application.

- **Endpoint:** `/app/status`
- **Method:** GET
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "cpu": 0.5,
    "replicas": 5
  }
  ```

### PUT /app/replicas

Updates the replica count of the ScaleIt application.

- **Endpoint:** `/app/replicas`
- **Method:** PUT
- **Request:**
  ```json
  {
    "replicas": 10
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Replica count set to 10"
  }
  ```
